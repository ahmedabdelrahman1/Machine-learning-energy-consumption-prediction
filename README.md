# Machine-learning-energy-consumption-prediction
Overview
This project focuses on predicting energy consumption using various machine learning models. Our goal was to accurately forecast energy usage based on historical data. The project was submitted to a Kaggle competition, where we secured first place.

Models Used
Linear Regression
Polynomial Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
Data Preprocessing
We performed the necessary data preprocessing steps to prepare the dataset for model training. This included:

Handling Missing Values: Imputing or removing missing data points.
Normalization and Standardization: Scaling features to improve model performance.
Feature Selection: Identifying and selecting the most relevant features.
Model Development and Hyperparameter Tuning
Each model was developed with carefully selected hyperparameters to enhance performance. We used k-fold cross-validation to ensure robust and reliable evaluation of our models.
